# 2010_website
Project as part of my Masters degree

This is a basic website that I made for the module "Language and Technology". It has long, long been offline, but I added it anyway because it is very dear to me: It made me rediscover the joy of coding!

So I suppose you can think of it as a kind of museum piece :)
